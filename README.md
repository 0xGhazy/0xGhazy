### More About Me

- 💡 I live by Richard Feynman’s quote: “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” This drives my passion for exploring how things work at a deep level, enabling me to not only understand but also improve and maintain them.

- 📖 I’m an avid reader, diving into a wide range of books—from technical guides and novels to religious, social, and philosophical works. Reading fuels my creativity and broadens my perspective.

- ✍️ I enjoy writing and sharing insights about what I’ve learned. My blog, 0xGhazy, is a space where I document my journey, share technical notes, and aim to inspire and benefit the developer community.

- 🌟 I believe that your value in life is measured by the impact you have on others. Through blogging and knowledge-sharing, I strive to contribute meaningfully to the technical ecosystem.
